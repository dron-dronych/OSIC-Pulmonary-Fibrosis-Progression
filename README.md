# OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression
## Predicting lung function decline

We are tasked with a problem to predict severity of a lung function decline based on a computed tomography (CT) scan.

### Dataset
Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) has provided chest scans and accompanying patient information. A patient has an image acquired at time Week = 0 and has numerous follow up visits over the course of approximately 1-2 years, at which time their FVC (forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled) is measured.
